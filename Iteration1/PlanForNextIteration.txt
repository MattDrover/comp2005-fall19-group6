Plan for next iteration:
-Begin implementing basic functionality of the Blokus game.
-Possibly make changes to use case descriptions, UI sketches, etc. based on feedback and
 experience gained while implementing the game.
-Break down parts of the game into classes, methods, etc. that group members can work on.
